# Project 2 Generative Audio

## Abstract

"Answer The Call"

Using Jukebox I plan on taking pleas from vitimcs of war, genocide, and pestilence and annocuments from political officals and switch the voices as a social experiment, seeing if the attention or level of importance/value would shift. Using easliy identifable voices that the masses recognize with power and the voices of children to serve as the inhereablely lesser valued voice, Would listeners be more compelled by the content or the voice. Will listeners join the call to action or would they be dismissive due to the tone and vocie rather then the contnet at all. I have not decied yet how I want to measure the listeners preference, but I will keep the details of which audio is true to the speaker and which is swapped.

## Model/Data

Using a mix of JukeBox and GPT2 text genration and recorded transcripts from civilians and politicans.

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
