## Abstract

"Does the Voice Have Power?"

Using voice cloning, I used Michelle Wolf's and Don LaFontaine's voices with the purpose of testing if we as people listen to the words or the voice. Addressing our biases and the value of more important issues, I used Greta Thunberg's speech from the U.N. Climate Change Summit and made Michelle Wolf say these words. For the voice of Don LaFontaine, I made his voice speak about a child's ted talk to increase school recess. Don LaFontaine is famous for his iconic movie narrations. He has a deep and raspy voice that most would say calls authority. Michelle Wolf is a comedian with a higher-pitched voice with a slight nasally sound. She is often referred to as having an annoying voice or one that is meant to be laughed at. Using Don to speak about recess and Michelle to speak about climate change, I was curious to see if we would think of the content differently based on who said it.

Script: "We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just 'business as usual' and some technical solutions?"

Don LaFontaine's Voice

Script: "I'm talking about why kids should have an hour-long recess. Research shows that you learn better and faster when having playtime. Work that has more breaks is more effective than work with loooong stretches."

Overall the Vocie Cloning kind of worked to protay the the concept but hearing them it just sounds like a man and woman speaking about to spereate topics. It was diffcult trying to add enough text to convey a message with the text limiter, but I narrowed it down enough without having too many issues. I attempted to work with children's vocies, as a clearer way to seperate speakers, but they were not cloned well enough forcing me to use another vocie.

## Technical Notes
Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
I scraped voices from youtube and converted them into wav files for the notebook to properly clone the vocie.
